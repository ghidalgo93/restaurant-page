# A simple Restaurant Web Page
A simple restaurant web page with a clean and simple interface, nothing too fancy, basic tab based navigation.

## Personal Notes
This web page was created as a simple project to practice developing with modules made available by the module bundler WebPack, npm package manager, the transpiler babel, and using npm as a task runner as well. 

Project Start: 12/29/20. In this project I want to practice using modules and being able to split up my code into logical and modular bundles. I am not too concerned with the design of this project right off the back as most of the things Iâ€™d like to practice using are more on the project-configuration side of things (npm, webpack, babel). 

Project End: 1/1/21. I was able to successfully use and setup all of the project configuration files, including a development server using npm CLI scripts. This dev-sever was an incredibly useful took and I believe will make future development move more quickly. I did over abstract a couple of concepts in this project, and hope to come back to this soon to make more improvements in the logic as well as design (ie. clean animations and transitions).

Future Notes: Implement reactive design for mobile and displays that change sizes.
